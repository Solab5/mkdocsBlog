## Applied Machine learning Consulting Services

I aim to empower you to launch AI products with confidence and precision, swiftly navigating past the AI hype to secure a dream outcome: more users, superior data quality, and enhanced product development. This approach not only elevates your team but also optimizes time and effort, paving the way for success.

I deviate from the typical consultant archetype. Whether advantageous or disadvantageous, I've gained substantial hands-on experience, and my aim is to assist you in reducing potential regrets. I do so by imparting the insights I've acquired and providing clear guidance on where to allocate resources and what projects to prioritize.
