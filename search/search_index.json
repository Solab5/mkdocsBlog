With this library, users can effortlessly compute ANOVA and Chi-square tests without the need to handle complex computations themselves. If you've ever used software like Stata, you're likely familiar with how easily you can obtain outputs for tests such as ANOVA. However, when working with Python, performing tasks like ANOVA can be time-consuming. For instance, you may need to manually create groups, split data, and then apply statistical functions like <code>one_way</code> from the <code>scipy</code> library. This process can be tedious and frustrating, especially when Python offers such streamlined data analysis capabilities for most tasks. </p> <p>In my experience, dealing with these specific tests in Python has been particularly cumbersome. While exploring options to simplify this process, I experimented with tools like <code>pystata</code>, which aim to bridge the gap between Stata and Python environments. However, I found these solutions to be cumbersome as they essentially provide a separate environment without integrating the functionality seamlessly into Python code. </p> <p>This led me to develop my own solution\u2014a library that streamlines these statistical tests while remaining easy to use. I've decided to share this library with others in the hope that it might prove helpful in simplifying statistical analysis tasks for fellow Python users. Using this library is straightforward, making it accessible to users of all skill levels.</p>"},{"location":"writing/#how-to-use","title":"How to use","text":"<p>You will have to install the library first from pypi using  <pre><code>pip install staty-tests==0.1.0\n</code></pre></p> <pre><code>    from statistical_tests.tests import StatisticalTests\n    import pandas as pd\n\n    # Create an instance of StatisticalTests with your dataframe\n    dataframe = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')\n    tests = StatisticalTests(dataframe)\n\n    # Perform one-way ANOVA\n    tests.one_way_anova('dependent_variable', 'group_variable1', 'group_variable2')\n\n    # Perform chi-square test\n    tests.chi_square('variable1', 'variable2')\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"writing/#output","title":"Output","text":"<p>The output of staty-tests is like this: </p>"},{"location":"writing/#comparisons-to-stata","title":"Comparisons to stata","text":"<ul> <li> <p><code>tests.one_way_anova('dependent_variable', 'group_variable1')</code> is similar to <code>oneway 'dependent_variable','group_variable1'</code> but you can add as many variables as you want.
